## Capstone Research Project

### 🔹 FynVerse – RAG-Enhanced AI Stock Trading Simulator
- **Technologies:** SwiftUI, FastAPI, Machine Learning, RAG, LLMs
- **Status:** Peer-reviewed conference paper (IEEE ICICNIS 2025)
- **Focus:** Portfolio analytics, anomaly detection, conversational AI
- **Repository:** https://github.com/zubair0831/FynVerse

## Computer Vision & Image Processing Research

### 🔹 AI Crowd Monitoring System for Stampede Prevention
- **Focus:** Real-time crowd density estimation and early risk detection
- **Description:** Developed a web-based crowd monitoring system that detects and counts people in video footage using the P2PNet deep learning model. The system provides real-time statistics, visual overlays, and automatic alerts when crowd density exceeds safe thresholds.
- **Key Features:** Crowd counting, heatmap visualization, configurable alert limits, real-time video analysis
- **Repository:** https://github.com/zubair0831/crowd-density-prediction

### 🔹 Interpreting What CNNs Learn in Early Vision Layers
- **Focus:** Understanding low-level visual representations learned by CNNs
- **Description:** Analyzed first-layer filters from multiple CNN architectures and compared them with classical image processing operators (Sobel, Prewitt, Gaussian, Laplacian, Gabor) using spatial and frequency-domain analysis.
- **Architectures:** ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, DenseNet121
- **Repository:** https://github.com/zubair0831/Interpreting-What-CNNs-Learn-in-Early-Vision-Layers

## Machine Learning Research

### 🔹 Ensemble Learning – Generalization Gap Analysis
- **Focus:** Bias–variance trade-offs and generalization behavior in ensemble models
- **Repository:** https://github.com/zubair0831/ensemble-generalization-gap

---

## Software Engineering & Application Development

### 🔹 MapApp – SwiftUI MVVM Location Explorer
- **Focus:** Clean MVVM architecture and state-driven UI design
- **Repository:** https://github.com/zubair0831/swiftui-mapapp-mvvm

### 🔹 TodoList App – SwiftUI Fundamentals
- **Focus:** State management and SwiftUI data flow
- **Repository:** https://github.com/zubair0831/swiftui-todolist
